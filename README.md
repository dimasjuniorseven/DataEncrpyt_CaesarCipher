## Introduction
This practicum assignment is part of the Information System and Network Security course, aimed at providing a deeper understanding of basic encryption concepts and their application in securing data. In this report, we will discuss the implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the simplest encryption methods used to encrypt messages by shifting the position of each letter in the text by a certain amount. Although the Caesar Cipher is an ancient encryption technique, it remains relevant for learning the basic principles of cryptography.

In this practicum, the implementation of the Caesar Cipher is done using the **Python** programming language, which allows for easy encryption and decryption of messages in an understandable way. The objective of this practicum is to understand how the encryption algorithm works and its application in securing information within computer systems. Through this assignment, students are expected to learn the fundamentals of encryption techniques and develop skills in using simple algorithms to protect data.
